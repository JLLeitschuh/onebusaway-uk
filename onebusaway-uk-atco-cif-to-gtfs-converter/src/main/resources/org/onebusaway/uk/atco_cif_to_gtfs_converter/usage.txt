Usage:

  [args] atco_cif_input_path gtfs_output_path

Args:

  The program requires two arguments:
  
    atco_cif_input_path - a path point to either a CIF file or a directory
      containing CIF files, that will be read as input.
    gtfs_output_path - a path where the resulting GTFS feed will be
      written.
  
  The following optional arguments can be used to control how the agency entry
  in the GTFS agency.txt file is populated:

    --agencyId=...        specify the agency id used for the feed
    --agencyName=...      specify the agency name used for the feed
    --agencyUrl=...       specify the agency url used for the feed
    --agencyTimezone...   specify the agency timezone used for the feed
    --agencyLang=...      specify the agency lang used for the feed
    --agencyPhone=...     specify the agency phone used for the feed

  Because ATCO CIF files don't specify vehicle types (bus vs rail) in a
  consistent way, you can specify the GTFS vehicle type for routes in the new
  GTFS feed:
   
    --vehicleType=...     specify a default GTFS route vehicle type for the feed
 
 Advanced Options:
 
  --preferredDirectionIdsForRouteDetails=...
  
    Specify as a comma-separated list of direction ids (eg. "IN,OUT") that will
  be used to fill in additional details for GTFS routes.txt entries from ATCO-CIF 
  route+direction specific records.  For example, the `route_long_name` field will
  be set using QD Route Direction records for a particular route, trying each
  specified direction id in turn until we find a usable value.

  --generateRouteForEachDirection
  
    Generate a unique entry in the GTFS routes.txt file for each route+direction
  combination in the input data.  Normally, different directions for the same
  route are groups together under the same GTFS route.

  --keepStopsWithNoLocationInfo 

    If specified, stops without location information in your ATCO CIF feed will
  still be included in the GTFS output.  By default, they are pruned.  These
  stops will have empty coordinates (0.0, 0.0).
  
  --pruneStopsWithPrefix=...
    
    Prune stops that have the specified stop id prefix.
  
  --keepTripsWithMissingStops  
  
    If specified, Trips that include pruned stops will be included in the GTFS
  output.  Normally, they are excluded.
  
  --locationScaleFactor=...
  
    If the northing and easting values for additional location (QB) records have 
  been multiplied by some scale factor, specify it with this flag so that the values
  can be properly adjusted.
    
  --nationalExpressExtensions
  
    If specified, the converter will look for custom National Express ATCO CIF
  records and use them to augment the GTFS feed.
